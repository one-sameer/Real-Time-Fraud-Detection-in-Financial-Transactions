# Real-Time-Fraud-Detection-in-Financial-Transactions

Domain Overview: This project focuses on fraud detection in digital financial transactions, a critical
challenge in FinTech due to the high volume of daily transactions and the severe financial impact of even
rare fraudulent activities. Fraud datasets are typically imbalanced, high-dimensional, and dynamic,
rendering traditional rule-based methods insufficient. Machine learning models can efficiently detect
complex, evolving fraud patterns, hecnce proving to be a scalable and adaptive solution.
Relevance: Accurate real-time fraud detection is essential for financial institutions to reduce losses,
prevent false positives, and maintain customer trust. ML-based systems can automatically identify subtle and previously unseen fraudulent patterns, enhancing operational efficiency and compliance with
regulatory requirements.
